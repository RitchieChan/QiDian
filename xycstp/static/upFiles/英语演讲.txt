   It was the best of times: We live an advanced and convennient modern lives with rapid development of technology.It was the worst of times too:thearetened by all kinds of environmental pollutions, we seem to lose the chance to breath,eat,drink freely. So today, I want to share you 
some ways to battle the pollution.
 First , we should know what pollution there are.
The first one , air pollution.Most air pollution comes from the human activity of burning natural gas, coal and oil for industries and motor vehicles,
which harms your breathing system quitely. The other two  kinds are land pollution. and water pollution ,which are caused by littering, improper disposal of domestic and industrial waste, and use of fertilizers and pesticides in farming. When you drinkand eat, maybe the toxic chemical gets into your body.
  But what actions can we take to fight these pollutions? The three "Rs' may help us.
The first one ,and the most important one , "reduce".Make your shopping plan in  advance and 
reduce unreasonable shopping.Second,learning to reuse,take your canvas bag is a good choice when you go shopping,which is definitely eco-freindly.The last one is recycle. Collecting and marketing the usable
materials in your life to make use of resrouces.
  As presiedent XI says:"Green mountains and clear water are equal to mountains of gold and silver.."
So let's take actions now to protect the environment——the most precious treasure we possess!
